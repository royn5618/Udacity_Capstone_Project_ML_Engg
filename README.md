## Project Overview

Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets is a Kaggle Challenge where tweets are collected with labels indicating whether the tweets are about a disaster that occurred or not. Since tweets are social media language, therefore, it is a challenge to automatically identify them. Besides, ambiguity in texts makes it more difficult to achieve automatic identification of tweets containing information on real disaster. The objective of this project is to predict using machine learning if a tweet contains information on occurrence of a real disaster or not.
